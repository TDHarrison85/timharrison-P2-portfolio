The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract

When financial institutions want to extend credit they need to ascertain a customer's credit worthiness and probability of repaying the loan. Companies like Experian exist and can provide information that will aide in this decision. To have a more competitive edge banks can assess the credit worthiness of its customer's with this data, but also have access to their bank information. I want to create a way to segment customers that combines information gleaned from Experian data, like a FICO score, and use data only available to the bank to have a more holisitic way to assess credit worthiness.

# Introduction

## General Background Information

*Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis*

## Description of data and data source

I am going to create synthetic data using artificial intelligence software. I will have attributes that are received from Experian to simulate a credit report and customer attributes that I would be able to get from a bank.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

I can create a more holistic picture of a customer's credit worthiness if I factor in data only avaialable through a bank relationship.

<!-- To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in -->

<!-- introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the -->

<!-- YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the -->

<!-- right bibtex key. Then you can include like this: -->

<!-- Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in -->

<!-- [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] -->

# Methods

The data will be synthetically created with AI. I will use summary statistics to get an idea of the data and principle componenet analysis combined with cluster anlaysis to create groups.

<!-- ## Data aquisition -->

<!-- The data will be created. -->

<!-- ## Data import and cleaning -->

<!-- _Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._ -->

<!-- ## Statistical analysis -->

<!-- _Explain anything related to your statistical analyses._ -->

{{< pagebreak >}}

<!-- # Results -->

<!-- ## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis -->

<!-- _Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project._ -->

<!-- @tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data. -->

<!-- Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.** -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #| label: tbl-summarytable -->

<!-- #| tbl-cap: "Data summary table." -->

<!-- #| echo: FALSE -->

<!-- resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds") -->

<!-- knitr::kable(resulttable) -->

<!-- ``` -->

## Basic statistical analysis

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)


# Load the data
data_path <- here("starter-analysis-exercise","data", "raw-data", "fin_data.csv")
df <- read_csv(data_path)


# Summary statistics
summary_stats <- df %>%
  summarize(
    avg_fico = mean(`FICO Score`, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_income = mean(`Gross Monthly Income ($)`, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_obligations = mean(`Current Credit Obligations ($)`, na.rm = TRUE)
)

print(summary_stats)

# Create histograms for FICO Score, Current Credit Obligations, and Gross Monthly Income
fico_hist <- ggplot(df, aes(x = `FICO Score`)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) + 
  ggtitle("FICO Score Distribution")

income_hist <- ggplot(df, aes(x = `Gross Monthly Income ($)`)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) + 
  ggtitle("Gross Monthly Income Distribution")

obligations_hist <- ggplot(df, aes(x = `Current Credit Obligations ($)`)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) + 
  ggtitle("Current Credit Obligations Distribution")



# Display histograms
print(fico_hist)
print(income_hist)
print(obligations_hist)

```

<!-- _To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._ -->

<!-- @fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #| label: fig-result -->

<!-- #| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender." -->

<!-- #| echo: FALSE -->

<!-- knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png")) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Full analysis -->

<!-- _Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._ -->

<!-- Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- #| label: tbl-resulttable2 -->

<!-- #| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table." -->

<!-- #| echo: FALSE -->

<!-- resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds")) -->

<!-- knitr::kable(resulttable2) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Discussion -->

<!-- ## Summary and Interpretation -->

<!-- _Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._ -->

<!-- ## Strengths and Limitations -->

<!-- _Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._ -->

<!-- ## Conclusions -->

<!-- _What are the main take-home messages?_ -->

<!-- _Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_ -->

<!-- This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.  -->

<!-- These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.  -->

<!-- Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better. -->
