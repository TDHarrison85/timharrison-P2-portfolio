## Personal Profile

I am a devoted husband and father of three, eagerly anticipating the arrival of our fourth child. Our household is also home to two cats and a lovable dog. Prior to pursuing my current academic endeavor, I served in the Marine Corps as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician, culminating my service as a Chief Warrant Officer 2.

## Professional Background

My academic journey led me to specialize in Statistics and Data Science, with a concentration in Actuarial Science, complemented by a certification in Business Analytics from UTSA. Having graduated just last year, I embarked on a fulfilling career path. Following an enriching internship experience at USAA, I was offered a full-time role as a Credit Risk Analyst. My primary focus lies in the realm of auto loans, although I also manage other secured retail banking loans. Day in and day out, I harness the power of SQL within SAS to identify opportunities for optimizing strategies. Additionally, I collaborate closely with Tableau dashboard developers, facilitating seamless communication of business requirements, data query provision, and rigorous QA inspections on the generated Tableau output.

## Personal Interests and Activities

A tidbit about me: my international travels outweigh my domestic adventures within the United States. During my leisure hours, I find solace in maintaining our home, indulging in activities like lawn care, barbecuing, car detailing, and the gratifying task of pressure washing our driveway.
